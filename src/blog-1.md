TypeScriptâ€™s union and intersection types offer a powerful way to manage multiple data types and complex structures in your code. They help create flexible, reliable applications, making code both safer and easier to read.

Union types:>----------------------------------------------

Union types offer versatility without compromising type safety by enabling a variable to hold many types. Consider it a _either-or_ scenario.

For instance:

let id: string | number; id = "NH123"; id = 832; ```typescript

In this case, `id` can be a string or a number, which is helpful when working with user input or variable data sources.

Uses-->- Taking in different kinds of input.
Managing erratic API returns.
Functions that return various result kinds.

Intersection types=>--------------------------------------------------------------

A variable can fulfill all of the combined types thanks to intersection types, which merge several types into one. Consider it a relationship between _and_.

For instance:

````typescript type Discounted = { discount: number }; type Product = { name: string; price: number };

type Product & Discounted = DiscountedProduct;

saleItem const discountProduct = { name: "Laptop", price: 1000, discount: 10 }; ```

`DiscountedProduct` is ideal for combining complex data structures because it contains all of the attributes of both `Product` and `Discounted`.

Uses =>

Combining pre-existing kinds to create complicated ones.
Enhancing an existing structure with additional features.
Developing modular, reusable types.
